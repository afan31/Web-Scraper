# Web-Scraper

Implemented a Web Scraper in Ruby to scrape the housing listings in all the pages of the Airbnb website. The data is stored in a csv file and lists down the following information :

-> Location Name

-> Price 

-> Room Type

-> Number of Reviews

This data is then analyzed to remove all the badly formatted data, or to remove the data which doesn't belong to the correct column.
